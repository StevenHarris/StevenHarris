- 👋 Hi, I’m @StevenHarris
- 👀 I’m interested in System Administration, System Operations and automating these.  Emacs and Org Mode are my drugs of choice.
- 🌱 Gave up on J.  Dabble in Dyalog APL.  Want to be proficient in Forth but the learning curve is so steep. Currently learning lisps - Emacs Lisp, Picolisp, SBCL 
- 💞️ I’ve got an idea to re-implement emacs on a portable vm, such as the smalltalk vm used by squeak, pharo and cuis.  Why?  so there is a canonical portable implementation of Org Mode.
- 📫 How to reach me ...  let me think about that for a while.
